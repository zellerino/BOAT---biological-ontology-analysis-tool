================================

Dear researchers,

in my view there is a confusing jungle out there of different open source tools for gene set enrichment
analysis, many claiming to be better in some way than others. And although many have great features, the interesting functions seem 
to be all scattered in dozens of tools causing uncertainty about which tool to use by the researcher. Another problem is that the user often has profound knowledge of biology and medicine, which is essential for interpreting the data, but in many cases low knowledge about how these tools work and thus use them only as a black boxes, thereby risking over-interpretation of of the results or under-utilization of the tool.

In order to counteract these problems, my idea is to work in a bigger collaboration on a tool in R that has all the cool features of tools so far, is user-friendly for the researcher, has great visualizations that simplify interpretations and uncover interesting relations, and comes with additional information that is easy to understand, so that the tool doesn't stay a black box for the user.

I am actually a trained biochemist, but in an internship I created a gene set enrichment tool for gene ontology terms, KEGG pathways, and panther pathways that works for D. melanogaster. The code is probably horrible in the eye of an expert, but I am glad I created a working gene set enrichment tool as a Biochemist with no prior knowledge of computer science. It was both a fun and challenging project for me. Since this project I have begun taking online computer science classes because I really felt in love with Bioinformatics and want to continue in this direction.

My wish is that BOAT becomes a big collaborative project with many skilled and creative people involved. A lot of inspiration for creating this first prototype tool came from a chapter in the free gene ontology handbook http://www.springer.com/us/book/9781493937417 written by the very talented Bioinformatician Sebastian Bauer. Furthermore, I want to state that I am not interested in any academical merits, but interested in starting a project for collaboratively creating a tool that is easy to use, is strongly geared to the needs of the reasearcher and has great visualizations in order to provide the research community with a reliable tool that enhances there research outcomes.
